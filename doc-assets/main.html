  This class is meant to allow for access to Record Type information from within other classes.
  <br />
  It is called statically, and therefore will supply the same information to all calls made from within one transaction, or set of trigger calls. This is beneficial because this
  info should be the same for all calls in a transaction, and by calling it statically we reduce the calls that are made, making the total transaction more efficient.

  <br />
  This class is allows for easy, readable access to Record Type information from other classes.
  <br />
  Usage recommendation: Always use DeveloperName instead of Name, as this is more likely to be hard-coded in places, while the Name is actually a label and may change (especially
  due to user language).

<h1>Record-Types</h1>
<p>This is a project based on work by <a href="https://github.com/groundwired">Evan Callahan</a> (formerly of Groundwire, and now at Salesforce) who wrote <a href="https://github.com/SalesforceFoundation/JenkinsTesting/blob/master/src/classes/RecordTypes.cls">this class</a> a long time ago to reduce the number of describe calls required to work with Record Types.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve updated the project (by pulling test code out of the main class - that&#39;s how old it was!) and have added some additional methods.</p>
<p>The included test class has 100% coverage, so pull this into your org and get cracking!</p>
