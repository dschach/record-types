# Record-Types

This is a project based on work by [Evan Callahan](https://github.com/groundwired) (formerly of Groundwire, and now at Salesforce) who wrote [this class](https://github.com/SalesforceFoundation/JenkinsTesting/blob/master/src/classes/RecordTypes.cls) a long time ago to reduce the number of describe calls required to work with Record Types.

I've updated the project (by pulling test code out of the main class - that's how old it was!) and have added some additional methods.

The included test class has 100% coverage, so pull this into your org and get cracking!
