# record-types
This is a project based on work by Evan Callahan (formerly of Groundwire, and now at Salesforce) who wrote this class a long time ago to reduce the number of describe calls required to work with Record Types.

I've updated the project (by pulling test code out of the main class - that's how old it is!) and have added some additional methods. 

The included test class has 100% coverage, so pull this into your org and get cracking!
